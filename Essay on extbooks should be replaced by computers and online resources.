Textbooks are traditional resources that any student refers to gain knowledge. These are used to teach and study in schools, colleges, universities, and any 
educational institutions. Textbooks have many categories like academic textbooks, articles, journals and others like that. Students generally used textbooks to get
more information and references, especially in schools. 
But nowadays, a new trend is getting developed for study especially and that is online content for any references. It is quite easy to get in touch with the internet 
and google whatever we want. Weighted books and notebooks have been limited to now slim phones or laptops with a dense source of knowledge. In minutes, there is an 
option to compare and get precise information about almost everything, which is very handy as well. Today, no need to carry heavy books, journals, or articles and no 
need to search for a group of people even to study or discuss anything. In fact, today is the scenario where even no need to type the complete words or sentences to 
search for. Google assistance is there and also if somebody doesn’t know to type then that person can speak and get the required result. Absolutely no need for anyone’s 
interference and the entire world is yours.
But, as it is said that “Excess of everything is bad”, it is connected to here as well. Since the world is in our fists but slowly, we are forgetting the base model 
of learning. It is impacting our mental capability. Previously, we were focusing on concentration and logical learning ladder-wise patiently but today we want everything
with a single click. We don’t put effort to memorize or think for a while to recall anything. Just click a button and the result is there. It is making us mental slave 
of a machine and we are not a human anymore in today’s scenario.
